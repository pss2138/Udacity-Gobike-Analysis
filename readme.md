## Summary of Findings

> The number of usage has been decreased more than half in March.
> As the 'duration_second'(Trip Duration) has a lot of outliers, we need to adjust the data only from 0 to 1775 seconds.
> In the "Number of Usage between User Types per Month" graph, the subscriber has been decreased from 250,000 in February to less than 100,000 in March. Also, the general customers has been decreased around 50,000 numbers.
> In the "Number of Usage between Access Methods per Month" graph, the application has been decreased from 250,000 in February to less than 100,000 in March. Also, the clipper users has been decreased less than half.
> Both application and the clipper users slightly have the decreasing usage from February to March.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Most of the time, the total amount of usage has been decreased from February to March regardless of the user types or the access methods. Therefore, we need to keep in mind that since the COVID-19 situation started, it truely affected the GoBike business.
> the long-vast virus situation might have made the users to stop the subscribtion of GoBike, as well as the usage of the application. Therefore, GoBike has to make the original subscribers loyal with events such as discount not to lose them.
> The tendency of decreasing in subscribers and the clippers especially means that people do not see the GoBike in long-term right now. Because no one knows when will become safe to ride a bike outside. Therefore, GoBike has to stop losing subscribers and make an idea to make profit to the instant GoBike users.
